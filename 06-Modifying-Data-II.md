# Stata Recitation - Week 6 - Modifying Data II
McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University

## Key Ideas:
 - Use if-statements
 - Create indicator variables
 - Verify results  

## If statements
 - We have seen if statements in passing - now we will cover them thoroughly
 - If statements restrict commands, making them act on a portion of the data set.

```
clear
sysuse auto 
```

### Basic usage
* Summary stats for foreign cars

```
sum weight length mpg if foreign==1
```
* Can use several different logical operators
```
help operators
```
* Summary stats for domestic cars
```
sum weight length mpg if foreign!=1
```
* If statements work with string variables, but require quotes
```
list make weight length mpg if make=="Buick Riviera" 
```
* Can make complex conditions with and/or
* Summary stats for heavy domestic cars
```
sum weight length mpg if foreign==0 & weight>=3317 
```
* Question: Summary stats for light (weight<=3317) or short (length<=196) domestic cars.

```
sum weight length mpg if foreign==0 & (weight<=3317 | length<=196)
```


### Ways to go wrong with if statements 


#### 1. Missing values 
```
tab rep78
list make rep78 if rep78>4
list make rep78 if rep78>999999
```
* Missing values are the **biggest** numbers Stata can hold.
* If you don't want to include them:
```
list make rep78 if rep78>4 & rep78!=.
```

#### 2. Complex conditions without parentheses
* domestic cars that are light or short
```
tab foreign if foreign==0 & (weight<=3317 | length<=196)
```
* domestic cars that are light plus all short cars
```
tab foreign if foreign==0 & weight<=3317 | length<=196
```
*** Always use parentheses when mixing if/and conditions ***


#### 3. Equal statements with non-integers 
* Find the car with the biggest gear ratio:
```
sum gear_ratio
list make gear_ratio if gear_ratio==3.89
list make gear_ratio if gear_ratio>3.88999 & gear_ratio<3.89001
describe
```

* Any variable that has decimal values may have a hidden `.00000000001`, 
* or some similar very small deviation that will make it not `==`
* Don't use `==` with decimal valued variables

## In Class Activity 1

Using the `nlsw88` data set, attempt to answer the following questions.

Create a `do-file` and `log-file` showing your work with proper comments.

1. What is the average wage of nonunion white workers in professional service industry as Sales or Laborers? Is that varies by marriage status?
2. Among those who earn second highest wage in the sample, how many of them are single?

```
*1
bysort married : sum wage if union==0 & race==1 & industry==11 & /// 
(occupation==3 | occupation==8)

*2
sum wage, detail
tab married  if wage>40.19807 & wage <40.19809
```


## Generating variables with if statements
### Most common usage is indicator variables
* Create an indicator for lowprice cars

```
sum price
gen lowprice = 0
replace lowprice = 1 if price <= 6000

browse make price lowprice
sum price if lowprice==1
sum price if lowprice==0
```
* To Check: Look at max and min for both summarize results

* Create an indicator for low rep78 
```
tab rep78
gen lowrep78 = 0
replace lowrep78 = 1 if rep78<=3
```
* Use two-way tab to verify results
```
tab rep78 lowrep78
```
* That looks good, but what about missing values?
```
tab rep78 lowrep78 , missing
```
* Missing values were set to zero in initial statement, and never changed
* We need one more case:
```
replace lowrep = . if rep78==.
```

#### Whenever you create an indicator, you need to consider three cases:
1. When should the indicator equal 0
2. When should the indicator equal 1
3. When should the indicator equal .

#### Always verify results:
 - Use summarize for continuous variables
 - Use twoway tab with missing option for categorical/discrete variables

* - When (not if) you find mistakes, fix them where the variable was created,
* - not where you found the mistake.



## Many ways to construct indicator variables ... 
* Create an indicator that equals 1 for all cars that have mpg between 20-29


### Specify each possible value 
```
sysuse auto.dta, clear

gen midmpg = 0
replace midmpg = . if mpg==.
replace midmpg = 1 if mpg==20
replace midmpg = 1 if mpg==21
replace midmpg = 1 if mpg==22
replace midmpg = 1 if mpg==23
replace midmpg = 1 if mpg==24
replace midmpg = 1 if mpg==25
replace midmpg = 1 if mpg==26
replace midmpg = 1 if mpg==27
replace midmpg = 1 if mpg==28
replace midmpg = 1 if mpg==29

tab mpg midmpg, missing
```

### Specify each possible value using `inlist()` function 
```
sysuse auto.dta, clear

gen midmpg = 0
replace midmpg = . if mpg==.
replace midmpg = 1 if inlist(mpg,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29)

tab mpg midmpg, missing
```

### Specify a range 
```
sysuse auto.dta, clear

gen midmpg = 0
replace midmpg = . if mpg==.
replace midmpg = 1 if mpg>=20 & mpg<30 

tab mpg midmpg, missing
```

### Specify a range using `inrange()` function 
```
sysuse auto.dta, clear

gen midmpg = 0
replace midmpg = . if mpg==.
replace midmpg = 1 if inrange(mpg,20,29) 

tab mpg midmpg, missing
```

* Use recode command (for reference)

```
sysuse auto.dta, clear

recode mpg (0/19 =0) (20/29 =1) (30/max =0) (.=.), gen(midmpg)

tab mpg midmpg, missing
```
 
## In Class Activity 2

Using the `nlsw88` data set, attempt to answer the following questions.

Create a `do-file` and `log-file` showing your work with proper comments.

1. Generate an indicator variable called `wage_indicator`. 
    - The indicator equal `5` if the person's weekly wage is above 75 percentile (rich guys).
    - The indicator equal `1` if the person's weekly wage is below 25 percentile (poor guys).
    - The indicator equal `.` otherwise.
2. What is the average hourly wage for rich guys who work in Manufacturing, Transport/Comm/Utility, or Wholesale/Retail Trade industry (Hint: Try `inlist`)?


```
*1
gen wage_indicator=.
gen weekly_wage=hours*wage
sum weekly_wage, detail
replace wage_indicator=1 if weekly_wage<r(p25)
replace wage_indicator=5 if weekly_wage>r(p75)

*2
sum wage if inlist(industry,4,5,6) & wage_indicator==5
```
